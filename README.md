#App data analysis

This notebook opens up Apple and Google data sets for apps which are in use. The purpose of the analysis is to find an app that a client can create based on certain indeces such as popularity, number of downloads, genre type. 

As I sorted through the datasets and cleaned many duplicate values, I found that the best Genre to create an app would be the reference or book market.
